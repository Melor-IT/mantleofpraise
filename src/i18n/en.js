    'At Mantle of Praise, we’re more than just a team – we’re a family. Together we worship, learn, serve, and grow. The ministry is led by the Leadership Team and spiritually overseen by the Levites, but in truth, every member is part of God’s garden. Each of us serves in our own place: the Worship & Music Team, the Education Team, the Media & Translation Team, and those who help organize gatherings and events. Our homegroup leaders and youth leaders also walk alongside us to prepare the new generation for the future. We believe this: we do the gardening, but only God gives the growth and the fruit.',

    'Mantle of Praise was born out of prayer, the leading of the Holy Spirit, and a deep passion for worship. The founders, with years of experience in worship and church ministry, together with their families, established this ministry as a place to encounter God, to grow spiritually, and to serve both Farsi-speaking and international churches. We know firsthand the power of true worship – it renews hearts, transforms lives, and builds the Church. The vision of Reda-ye Setayesh is to equip worshippers and raise up a new generation of leaders who are rooted in God’s Word and who worship in freedom and the power of the Holy Spirit. In Reda-ye Setayesh, everyone is welcome – whether you’re new to worship or have many years of experience. We believe worship is a calling for all God’s children, and He desires everyone to experience His presence in freedom. We are here to encourage one another, worship together, and witness the fresh works of God.'
