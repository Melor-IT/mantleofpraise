    'Bij Mantle of Praise zijn we niet zomaar een team; we zijn een familie. Samen aanbidden, leren, dienen en groeien we. De leiding van deze dienst wordt verzorgd door het leiderschapsteam en de geestelijke supervisie van de Levieten, maar de waarheid is dat wij allemaal een belangrijk onderdeel zijn van de Mantle of Praise-familie. Ieder van ons dient op zijn of haar plek: het aanbids- en muziekteam, het trainingsteam, en degenen die bijeenkomsten en evenementen organiseren. Ook jeugdleiders zijn bij ons om de volgende generatie voor te bereiden op de toekomst. Wij geloven: wij zijn instrumenten van dienst, maar groei en zegen komen alleen van God.',
  leder: 'Leadership Team',
  lederText:
    'Mantle of Praise was born out of prayer, the leading of the Holy Spirit, and a deep passion for worship. The founders, together with their families and drawing on years of experience in worship and church ministry, established this ministry as a place to encounter God, grow spiritually, and serve both Farsi-speaking and international churches. We have experienced firsthand the power of true worship – it renews hearts, transforms lives, and builds the Church. The leadership team of Mantle of Praise is responsible for guiding all spiritual and operational activities of the ministry. This team consists of members with deep commitment and experience in worship and church service and makes key decisions for the growth and development of the ministry under the spiritual guidance of the Levites. Responsibilities of the leadership team include advancing policies and programs, coordinating worship and training teams, leading meetings and events, managing resources and budget, and supporting ministry members. Each leadership team member contributes with a devoted heart to creating a healthy, spiritual, and creative environment for worship and faith growth. The vision of Mantle of Praise is to equip worshippers and raise up a new generation of leaders who are rooted in God’s Word and who worship in the freedom and power of the Holy Spirit. At Mantle of Praise, everyone is welcome – whether you are new to worship or have years of experience. We believe worship is a calling for all of God’s children, and He desires that everyone experience His presence in freedom. Here, we encourage one another, worship together, and witness the fresh works of God.',
